WHAT'S IN IT?

Paul Irish's HTML5 Boilerplate is a great place to start for next-generation
web project, providing you're a fan of jQuery ;) It packages a whole heap of 
useful tools - modernizr to add HTML5 elements to IE6/7/8, jQuery via Google
CDN (with a local fallback), etc. It also overrides console.log() to provide
much more useful behaviour.

This packaging of the boilerplate simply wraps it up into a good base Django
template for use in your django projects, with each chunk of the boilerplate
wrapped up into blocks for you to override/customise at your convenience.


HOW TO USE IT

The paths in the base.html template are configured to work with Django's 
default MEDIA_ROOT setting; drop the contents of the 'media' folder into your
media root and everything should work. If you're using a different MEDIA_ROOT
than '/media/', then you'll need to update the pathing in the base.html 
accordingly

Place the contents of 'templates' folder into a directory you've included in
your TEMPLATE_DIRS list, and rename the 'myapp' subfolder to the name of your
first app. Providing base.html is at the root of a TEMPLATE_DIRS directory,
you can simply {% extends 'base.html' %} in any of your templates to get all
of the HTML5 Boilerplate's included functionality.
